# Witness Random Puzzle Generator

### [Click Here to Download (ver 1.1.1)](https://github.com/chuukunn/witness-randomizer/releases/download/1.1.1/despair_randomizer_1.1.1.zip)

#### For those who are not satisfied with Expert, I publish a randomizer that implements an even more difficult puzzle.
 Panels with left-right rotation, very many tetris, and arrows. I have created a difficulty level that will make all people despair.
 We hope you will enjoy it. If you do not enjoy it, despair over this.
* If you feel that the difficulty level is not enough, please contact me.
* Please note that puzzles will never be nerfed by version upgrades.


**How to use the Witness Random Puzzle Generator:**

1. Launch The Witness
2. Start a New Game
3. Launch WitnessRPG.exe (from any location)
4. Choose difficulty and seed (leave seed blank for random)
5. Click "Randomize" and wait for the process to complete
6. Enjoy your randomly created puzzles! Puzzles will revert to normal after closing the game.

**To resume where you left off after closing and relaunching the game:**

1. Load the save you were previously playing on, if it is not already loaded
2. Launch WitnessRPG.exe (from any location)
3. Click "Randomize" and wait for the process to complete. You don't have to enter the seed or difficulty again. This is because the seed and difficulty were stored in your save file when you randomized initially, so they will be automatically restored and used.


Please report any issues (such as unsolvable/broken puzzles) on the issues page. However, please read the **"Known Issues"** section in the wiki first, as your issue may be addressed there.

Thanks for playing this mod, and dead luck!
